## Description

For this module we were asked to model and synthesise a dataset using Python. The dataset should be a real-world phenomenon of data set of our choice and should contain at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables. 

For my project I chose to analyse the Earth's temperature dataset that I found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data


Requirements of the project:

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
