## Description

For this project we were asked to model and synthesise a dataset using Python. The dataset should be a real-world phenomenon of data set of our choice and should contain at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables. 

For my project I chose to analyse the Wine Quality dataset that I found on the Kaggle website link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009



### The red wine quality Dataset

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
This dataset was downloaded from the website kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) 


There are not any null values in the dataset. Total "null" values in the dataset is zero

### Correlation and Causation 
Reference: https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/statistical+language+-+correlation+and+causation

Two or more variables considered to be related, in a statistical context, if their values change so that as the value of one variable increases or decreases so does the value of the other variable (although it may be in the opposite direction). For example, for the two variables "hours worked" and "income earned" there is a relationship between the two if the increase in hours worked is associated with an increase in income earned. If we consider the two variables "price" and "purchasing power", as the price of goods increases a person's ability to buy these goods decreases (assuming a constant income).

Correlation is a statistical measure (expressed as a number) that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A correlation between variables, however, does not automatically mean that the change in one variable is the cause of the change in the values of the other variable.

Causation indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; i.e. there is a causal relationship between the two events. This is also referred to as cause and effect.

Theoretically, the difference between the two types of relationships are easy to identify â€” an action or occurrence can cause another (e.g. smoking causes an increase in the risk of developing lung cancer), or it can correlate with another (e.g. smoking is correlated with alcoholism, but it does not cause alcoholism). In practice, however, it remains difficult to clearly establish cause and effect, compared with establishing correlation.###

This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down at first request. I am not the owner of this dataset.
