# 22-23: Project 1 - PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYSIS

## Description

For this project we were asked to analyse and synthesise a dataset using Python. The dataset should be a real-world phenomenon of data set of our choice and should contain at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables. 

For my project I chose to analyse the Wine Quality dataset that I found on the Kaggle website in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

I chose to analyse this dataset because it is a subject I enjoy reasearching and have affinity with the variables. The filename in this repository is <b>PdDA_Assignment.ipynb</b>.

## Project structure

The Red Wine dataset consists on 1599 rows and 12 variables. From those variables, 11 are inputs and 1 is an output. For the purpose of this project I decided to analyse the 4 variables that have more correlation to the output.

I started the investigation by giving an introduction of the variable and the dataset background. Then, I analysed the variables and its correlations, plotting my discoveries and drawing some conclusions. The next step was to analyse the 5 variables separately and try to understand which probability distributions they would be more likely to fit best. The most challenging part was to try to fit the data and compare to the original distribution plots. I have tried many different types of distributions from numpy.random and scipy.stats documentation and in some variables such as citric acid and quality I found very challenging and I was unsuccessfull in those analysis.

## Conclusion

It was a very interesting project in which I had to spend a considerable amount of time reseaching and trying the different distribution methods. There were a few arguments in some functions that I didn't know how to calculate so some distributions I was unable to execute. 

I have learned extensively about the numpy.random package and gained great knowlege in the importance of generating random data. At the end of the project, I attempted to create a model for machine learning based on KNN - Nearest neighbour algorithm and it was very enjoyable to understand better about this subject. 

Thank you.
